# BelezaAgency
Beleza Agency Portfolio

Beleza Agency is an agency that helps their promotion model's get contract work from their clients. For Beleza Agenzy I designed and architected the UI/UX of the company's web application using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. I allowed users to upload photos and incorporated AWS S3 buckets with endpoints to render image files, engineered PostgreSQL DB schema with ActiveRecord to handle models with 40+ attributes, persisted 400+ listing images for all users in AWS S3 and deployed web application and assets to AWS EC2, and built out an administrator view using JavaScript to establish which users had access to admin privileges.
